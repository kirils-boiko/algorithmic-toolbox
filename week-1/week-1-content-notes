STRESS TESTING
A technique for generating thousands of test with the goal of finding a test case for
which your solution fails.

Stress testing consists of four parts:
    1. Implementation of an algorithm.
    2. An alternative, trivial and slow, but correct implementation of an algorithm.
    3. A random test generator.
    4. An infinite loop in which a new test if generated and fed into both implementations
        to compared the results. If their results differ, the test and both answers are
        output, and the program stop, otherwise the loop repeats.
