# Algorithmic Toolbox #


## What is it?

This repository is designed to aid those currently learning algorithms as well as to track
my own learning process.
Specifically, it is aimed at providing content notes and my solutions source code to the [Algorithmic Toolbox Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/) as part of the broaded [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) offered by University of California San Diego and
HSE University on Coursera.
The course main focus is on practicing algorithms implementations, standard and stress testing of programs, and performance comparison of fast and slow programs.
